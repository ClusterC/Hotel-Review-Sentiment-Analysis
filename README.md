# Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel reviews to determine the sentiment expressed by customers. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, and potentially uncover underlying themes or aspects discussed in the reviews.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset could be sourced from various platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/), [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/), [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/), or other hotel review aggregators. For this example, let's assume a generic dataset structure.
- **Example Data Files**:
  - `hotel_reviews_train.csv`: The training set containing hotel reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.
  - `hotel_reviews_test.csv`: The test set for evaluating the trained model.
- **Features**:
  - `review_id`: A unique identifier for each review.
  - `review_text`: The actual text content of the hotel review.
  - `sentiment_label`: The sentiment category (e.g., 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral', or a numerical rating like 1-5 stars).
- **File Format**: CSV

## Methods Used

### 1. **Supervised Learning: Sentiment Classification**
   - **Models**:
     - Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM/GRU) or Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for more advanced analysis.
   - **Objective**: Classify hotel reviews into predefined sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
   - **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, TF-IDF vectorization, or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText).
   - **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC.
   - **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn (sklearn), nltk, spacy, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning: Topic Modeling / Clustering (Optional)**
   - **Method**:
     - K-Means Clustering (on document embeddings)
     - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.
   - **Objective**:
     - Group similar reviews together to identify common themes or aspects (e.g., "cleanliness," "staff," "location").
     - Discover latent topics discussed within the reviews.
   - **Evaluation**: Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin Index for clustering; Coherence score, perplexity, and qualitative analysis for topic modeling.
   - **Libraries**: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, gensim.

### 3. **Unsupervised Learning: Association Rule Mining (Optional)**
   - **Method**: Apriori or FP-Growth Algorithm (applied to frequent words or n-grams within sentiment categories).
   - **Objective**: Discover co-occurring words or phrases that are strongly associated with particular sentiments (e.g., "dirty room" often appearing in "negative" reviews).
   - **Evaluation**: Support, confidence, and lift metrics.
   - **Libraries**: pandas, mlxtend.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_link>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure `requirements.txt` includes pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, etc.)*

3.  **Data Loading**:
    - Place your dataset files (e.g., `hotel_reviews_train.csv`, `hotel_reviews_test.csv`) in a designated `data/` directory.
    - Load the dataset using `pd.read_csv()`.

4.  **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Clean the review text: handle missing values, remove punctuation, convert to lowercase.
    - Perform text-specific preprocessing:
        - Tokenization (splitting text into words or sub-words).
        - Stop-word removal (removing common words like "the", "is", "a").
        - Stemming or Lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).
    - Feature Extraction/Vectorization:
        - Convert text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, or word embeddings.

5.  **Model Training (Sentiment Classification)**:
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train your chosen classification model(s) (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, LSTM) on the preprocessed training data.
    - Evaluate the model(s) on the test set using appropriate metrics.

6.  **Topic Modeling / Clustering (If Applicable)**:
    - Apply K-Means or LDA to the preprocessed text data (or document embeddings).
    - Analyze the resulting clusters or topics to gain insights into common themes in reviews.

7.  **Association Rule Mining (If Applicable)**:
    - Prepare data by identifying frequent items (words/phrases) per sentiment category.
    - Apply FP-Growth or Apriori to discover association rules.

## Expected Results
- **Classification Performance**: Achieved sentiment classification accuracy/F1-score (e.g., an F1-score of 0.85 on the test set).
- **Key Themes/Topics**: Identification of prevalent topics discussed by customers (e.g., "excellent service," "comfortable beds," "noisy environment").
- **Sentiment-Word Associations**: Discovery of strong associations between specific words/phrases and sentiment categories (e.g., "highly recommend" strongly associated with "positive" sentiment).

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a robust system for hotel review sentiment analysis. By classifying sentiment and potentially identifying key aspects, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction, areas for improvement, and overall guest experience. Future work could involve aspect-based sentiment analysis, deploying the model as a web service, or incorporating more advanced deep learning architectures.
