# Hotel Review Score Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict hotel review scores based on the textual content of the reviews. By applying machine learning techniques, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), we will analyze the sentiment and content of customer reviews to estimate the rating a customer is likely to give.

## Dataset

-   **Source**: Provided dataset for a specific task/competition.
-   **Data Files**:
    -   `train_data.csv`: The training set, containing 18,441 hotel reviews with their corresponding scores.
    -   `test_data.csv`: The test set, containing 2,050 hotel reviews for which scores need to be predicted.
    -   `sample.csv`: A sample submission file demonstrating the correct output format.
-   **Columns**:
    -   `id`: A unique identifier for each review.
    -   `Review`: The textual content of the hotel review.
    -   `Rating`: The numerical review score (this is the target variable to be predicted).
-   **File Format**: CSV

## Methods Used

### 1. **Supervised Learning: Score Prediction**
    This project can be approached as either a **regression** problem (if scores are continuous or have a wide range) or a **multi-class classification** problem (if scores are discrete, e.g., 1 to 5 stars).

    -   **Potential Models**:
        -   **For Regression**: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
        -   **For Classification**: Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Neural Networks (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformer-based models like BERT for more advanced text understanding).
    -   **Objective**: To predict the `Rating` based on the `Review` text.
    -   **Text Preprocessing**:
        -   Tokenization (splitting text into words or sub-words).
        -   Lowercasing.
        -   Removal of punctuation and special characters.
        -   Stop-word removal (e.g., "the", "is", "a").
        -   Stemming or Lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).
    -   **Feature Extraction/Vectorization**:
        -   Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer).
        -   TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
        -   Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) followed by aggregation or input to neural networks.
    -   **Evaluation Metrics**:
        -   **For Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared (RÂ²).
        -   **For Classification**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score (especially macro/weighted for imbalanced classes), Confusion Matrix.
    -   **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (sklearn), nltk, spacy, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, xgboost, lightgbm.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    -   **Objective**: Understand the distribution of review scores, common words/phrases associated with different scores, review lengths, etc.
    -   **Techniques**: Word clouds, frequency distributions, sentiment distribution analysis.
    -   **Libraries**: matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable)**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_link>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment & Install Dependencies**:
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure `requirements.txt` includes pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, etc. based on your chosen methods.)*

3.  **Data Loading**:
    -   Place `train_data.csv` and `test_data.csv` in a designated `data/` directory or ensure they are in the root.
    -   Load data using `pandas`:
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        train_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/train_data.csv')
        test_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/test_data.csv')
        ```

4.  **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**:
    -   Clean the `Review` text as described in the "Methods Used" section.
    -   Convert the cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF, word embeddings, or other chosen vectorization techniques.

5.  **Model Training**:
    -   Split the training data into training and validation sets (e.g., using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`).
    -   Initialize and train your chosen regression or classification model on the processed training data.
    -   Tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for optimal performance.

6.  **Model Evaluation**:
    -   Evaluate the trained model on the validation set using appropriate metrics (RMSE, F1-score, etc.).
    -   Analyze errors and iterate on preprocessing or model choice if necessary.

7.  **Prediction & Submission**:
    -   Preprocess the `Review` text in `test_data.csv` using the same steps applied to the training data.
    -   Use the trained model to predict `Rating` for the test set.
    -   Format the predictions according to `sample.csv` (typically `id` and predicted `Rating`).
    -   Save the submission file.
        ```python
        # Example for creating a submission file
        # predictions = model.predict(processed_test_data)
        # submission_df = pd.DataFrame({'id': test_df['id'], 'Rating': predictions})
        # submission_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
        ```

## Expected Results
-   A trained machine learning model capable of predicting hotel review scores from text.
-   Performance metrics (e.g., RMSE for regression, or F1-score for classification) on a held-out validation set and potentially on the test set (if ground truth is available post-competition).
-   A submission file (`submission.csv`) in the format specified by `sample.csv`.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of NLP and machine learning to extract insights from customer feedback and predict review scores. The outcomes can help businesses understand customer sentiment, identify areas for improvement, and gauge overall satisfaction based on textual reviews. Further enhancements could include using more advanced deep learning models, aspect-based sentiment analysis to understand scores for specific hotel features, or deploying the model as an API.
